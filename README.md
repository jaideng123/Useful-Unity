# Useful-Unity
A collection of useful Unity scripts I take from project to project

- Usfeul Scriptable Objects (based off this talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk)
- A Camera Target System (Attach a component to an object that makes it a camera target for cinemachine)
- A State Machine System
- A Scene Reference that can be used outside of edit mode
